## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

## Credit and Collaborations

- **Logistical**
  - What hours will you be available to communicate?
    - Brandon - lab time, as needed
    - Christopher - lab time -> 2400 PDT
  - What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
    - Slack, Remo, Discord
  - How often will you take breaks?
    - 1800 PDT, As needed
  - What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
    - Pause, rebase, focus on MVP, plan
- **Cooperative**
  - Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
    - Brandon - logic {JavaScript} & design {CSS}
    - Christopher - front-end structure {React.js} "making things happen"
  - How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
    - Communicating what is needed for each feature and for the day. Researching what tools and resources will best serve us in developing this app. Utilize current knowledge to structure our frontend and backend via React, Node, JavaScript, etc. Persisting through the week and maintain a fervor that will lead to timely execution, and having fun!
  - In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
    - Christopher - JavaScript logic, better understanding of WRRC, modularization structure.
    - Brandon - WRRC, CSS frameworks
  - Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
    - Daily stand-up, discuss tasks in progress and make action plan.
- **Conflict Resolution**
  - What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
    - As team-member notices inconsistency, git rebase, communicate as team to determine how to adjust, and plan accordingly.
  - What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
    - Same as above, communicate.
  - How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
    - Realizing that we're all here to learn and are in a safe learning environment. Offering support to one-another and utilizing TA's when we are stuck or need more clarification. Emphasize use of Trello cards as a guide to structure our lab time and curriculum for project completion. Communicate exactly what resources, tools, and technologies are best suited to the individual based on their current knowledge base.
