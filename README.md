# Can of Books

**Author**: Brandon Rimes, Christopher Burk
**Version**: 3.0.1

## Overview

For today’s assignment, you will READ book data by connecting your front-end React app to a back-end Express server. Your Express server will connect to a Mongo database. You will need to make a “schema” in your back-end code to model how you want your data to look. You will then populate your database with “seed” data—some of your favorite books. When the front end makes a request to your server, your server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Your front end will display these results.

## Architecture

- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node.js
- React Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Cors
- Axios
- Mongoose

## Credit and Collaborations

Team Members:

- Brandon Rimes
- Christopher Burk

### Process: Professional Pairing Practice

Much of the work you will be doing in the industry will be in pairs. In order to best prepair you for this, you will be working with the same partner all week on this book app project.

Before you begin to even think about your application, take at least 30 minutes to make a team agreement with your partner. This is an essiential step to ensure a peaceful and productive week. You MUST answer the following questions in your agreement and include it in your README’s “Collaboration” section:

#### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?

  - Brandon - Lab time, as needed
  - Christopher - Lab time, up until 12:00am PDT

- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

  - Remo, Slack, Discord

- How often will you take breaks?

  - 6:00pm PDT, as needed

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

  - git pause, git step back, git rebase - as a group, refocus on MVP, draft action-plan to incorporate necessary steps for completion.

#### Cooperative

- Make a list of each parson’s strengths. (tech application, personality)

  - Brandon - logic articulation `(JavaScript)`, design `(CSS)`, communication, research
  - Christopher - Structuring front-end `(React)`, "making things happen", communication, persistance

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

  - MERN Stack

    - MongoDB, Express, React, Node
    - Node.js (backend)
    - React (frontend)
    - React Bootstrap
    - JavaScript
    - CSS (vanilla/tailwind)

  - Communicating what is needed for each feature and for the day.
  - Researching what tools and resources will best serve us in developing this app.
  - Utilize current knowledge to structure our frontend and backend via React, Node, JavaScript, etc. Persisting through the week and maintain a fervor that will lead to timely execution, and having fun!

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

  - Brandon - better understanding WRRC (web request response cycle), CSS frameworks/libraries (Bootstrap)
  - Christopher - JavaScript logic, better understanding of WRRC (web request response cycle), modularization structure

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

  - @ 1:00pm meet as a team and discuss what went right and wrong on the previous lab, discuss upcoming lab, realize how we can merge the previous and current labs to efficiently complete all tasks.
  - Divvy up tasks to necessary members for growth opportuinties and for timely results.

#### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

  - As team-member notices inconsistency, communicate with the team (not individually) their concern, git rebase, have a team huddle and discuss what we've been doing wrong, and plan accordingly.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

  - As team-member notices inconsistency, communicate with the team (not individually) their concern, git rebase, have a team huddle and discuss what we've been doing wrong, and plan accordingly.

- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

  - Realizing that we're all here to learn and are in a safe learning environment. Offering support to one-another and utilizing TA's when we are stuck or need more clarification. Emphasize use of Trello cards as a guide to structure our lab time and curriculum for project completion. Communicate exactly what resources, tools, and technologies are best suited to the individual based on their current knowledge base.
